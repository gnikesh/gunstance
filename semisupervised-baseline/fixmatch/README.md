This is an adaptation of the code from [https://github.com/iustinsirbu13/multimodal-ssl-for-disaster-tweet-classification](https://github.com/iustinsirbu13/multimodal-ssl-for-disaster-tweet-classification) in order to use text data.


## How to train a model
Examples of training scripts can be found in the `training_scripts` folder. 

For training all the models corresponding to `Experiment 1`, one could run the script
`./training_scripts/experiment1_train.sh`.

For training a single model, one could use the script
`./training_scripts/fixmatch_train_experiment.sh` with the corresponding arguments (similar to how it is run from experiment1_train.sh).
